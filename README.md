# Data-Visualization-Programming-Assignment-2
I chose the Amazon product co-purchasing network, June 01 2003 data set.  Network was collected by crawling Amazon website. It is based on Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought feature of the Amazon website. If a product i is frequently co-purchased with product j, the graph contains an edge from i to j.  I used only a subset of the data to avoid clutter.  I picked only five fromNodeIds 4,5,6,7, and 8 which are the blue square boxes.  There are fifty edges.  There are ten edges from each fromNodeId to ToNodeIds.  The edges are labeled by the fromNodeId.  From this graph, it is obvious that 5 was the item most often purchased with any other item.  All those who bought items 4 or 6 or 7 or 8 also bought item 5.
